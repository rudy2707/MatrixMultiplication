Matrix Multiplication

Compilation : make clean && make run

Message of makefile are not print because '@' option is used.

Test
----

In 'multmat.cc' change DEBUG to 1

It will change the output so you can load the output directly into octave

make clean && make run > out.m

This will redirect the output into 'out.m'

Open octave : octave --no-gui

run check

'check' programm will load 'out.m' and check if A * B = C

If you want to print anything on the console, print a '%' at the beginning of the line
so octave interprets it as a comment.
